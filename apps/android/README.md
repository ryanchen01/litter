# Android App

Android runtime is now on the same Rust-first architecture as iOS:

- `app`: Android entrypoint/activity.
- `core:bridge`: UniFFI-generated bindings plus Android Rust init/bootstrap.

## Runtime Architecture

- Canonical runtime state lives in Rust `AppStore` and is observed from `app/src/main/java/com/litter/android/state/AppModel.kt`.
- Direct upstream app-server methods come from generated `AppServerRpc`.
- Discovery uses Android NSD only for mDNS seeds; merge/dedupe/probing live in Rust `DiscoveryBridge`.
- SSH uses Rust `SshBridge`.
- Voice runtime uses Rust store/RPC for realtime state and Android-only code for audio capture/playback, AEC, and services.

## Local Runtime

- Android local runtime uses the same in-process Rust app-server model as iOS.
- `MainActivity` connects the default local server through `ServerBridge.connectLocalServer(...)`.
- There is no separate bundled Android Codex process in the active app path.
- `codex-bridge` is only the Android bootstrap/JNI shim; `codex-mobile-client` is the runtime surface.

Examples:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleOnDeviceDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleRemoteOnlyDebug
```

Open in Android Studio (macOS):

```bash
open -a "Android Studio" apps/android
```

Rebuild + reopen workflow:

```bash
./apps/android/scripts/rebuild-and-reopen.sh
```

Optional variants:

```bash
./apps/android/scripts/rebuild-and-reopen.sh --on-device
./apps/android/scripts/rebuild-and-reopen.sh --remote-only
./apps/android/scripts/rebuild-and-reopen.sh --both --with-rust
./apps/android/scripts/rebuild-and-reopen.sh --no-open
```

QA matrix and regression command list: `apps/android/docs/qa-matrix.md`.

## Rust Bridge (Android)

Android loads the Rust shared library `libcodex_bridge.so` through UniFFI init in `core:bridge`.
The generated Kotlin bindings live under `shared/rust-bridge/generated/kotlin/` and are consumed directly by `apps/android/core/bridge`.

Build and copy JNI artifacts into `core:bridge`:

```bash
./tools/scripts/build-android-rust.sh
```

Prerequisites:

- Android NDK (`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` set)
- `cargo-ndk` (`cargo install cargo-ndk`)
